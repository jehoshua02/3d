# 3D

A code kata spiraling out of control.

## Setup

```
npm install
```

## View Examples

Not really motivated to get this up on Github Pages yet, so just run locally.

```
npm run watch
```

This will open browser and start webpack. Refresh after build is ready.

## Run Tests on Core Library

```
npm run test
```

## What's Next?

See [TODO.md](TODO.md).
